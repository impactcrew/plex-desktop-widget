# PlexWidget Icon Concepts V2 - "NOW PLAYING" Focus

## Design Brief
Icons that clearly communicate "this is a media player showing what's playing RIGHT NOW" - not just generic music symbols.

### Requirements
- NO Plex logo or chevron (>)
- Must clearly represent PLAYER or NOW PLAYING status
- Work at 16x16px menu bar size
- Orange/yellow gradient colors
- Modern, professional look
- Must communicate "current playback" not just "music"

## CONCEPT 1: Mini Album with Play Badge

**Visual Description:**
A simplified album artwork square with a small circular play indicator in the corner, showing active playback.

```
┌─────────┐
│  ████   │  Small square (album art representation)
│  ████   │  with gradient fill
│  ████ ●│  Circle with play triangle in corner
└─────────┘  (orange gradient background, yellow play badge)
```

**Why It Works:**
- Album art = what the app actually shows
- Play badge = active playback indicator
- Combination clearly says "playing album"
- Recognizable as mini player at small size

**Colors:**
- Background square: Orange to yellow gradient
- Play badge: Bright yellow/white with orange play triangle

**At 16x16px:**
- 12x12px square for album
- 6x6px play badge overlapping corner
- Clean, readable contrast

## CONCEPT 2: Progress Bar with Dot Indicator

**Visual Description:**
A horizontal progress bar with a moving dot/scrubber, showing current playback position.

```
────●──────
Current position indicator on timeline
(Orange bar, yellow moving dot)
```

**Enhanced Version:**
```
┌──────────┐
│ ▶ ───●── │  Play icon + progress bar with position dot
└──────────┘
```

**Why It Works:**
- Progress bar = universal "playback in progress" symbol
- Dot = "current position" / "NOW" indicator
- Instantly recognizable from media players
- Different from generic music symbols

**Colors:**
- Progress track: Orange gradient
- Current position dot: Bright yellow (glowing effect)
- Play indicator: Yellow/orange

**At 16x16px:**
- Simplified to just bar + dot for clarity
- Dot slightly larger for visibility
- High contrast between bar and dot

## CONCEPT 3: "NOW" Time Badge

**Visual Description:**
A digital time display showing "NOW" or clock hands pointing to current moment, combined with subtle music note or speaker.

```
┌─────┐
│ NOW │  Digital display badge
└─────┘
   ♪    Small music indicator below
```

**Alternative:**
```
  🕐     Clock showing "current time"
  ♪     Music note indicator
```

**Why It Works:**
- "NOW" explicitly communicates current playback
- Time/clock = "what's playing right now"
- Combines temporal indicator with music context
- Clear semantic meaning

**Colors:**
- Badge/display: Orange to yellow gradient background
- Text "NOW": White or bright yellow
- Music indicator: Orange

**At 16x16px:**
- Simplified to "N" or clock icon
- Strong contrast for legibility
- Bold, simple shapes

## CONCEPT 4: Equalizer Bars with Play Triangle

**Visual Description:**
Active equalizer bars (animating visualization) with play triangle overlay, showing live playback.

```
▶ ▂▄▆▃▅  Play + animated EQ bars
```

**Full Version:**
```
┌──────────┐
│ ▶ ▂▄▆▃▅ │  Play triangle + EQ visualization
└──────────┘  (Orange to yellow gradient)
```

**Why It Works:**
- EQ bars = active audio visualization (not passive waveform)
- Play triangle = playback control context
- Combination = "player actively playing"
- Different heights suggest live animation/activity

**Colors:**
- Play triangle: Bright yellow
- EQ bars: Orange to yellow gradient (varying heights)
- Background: Subtle dark background or transparent

**At 16x16px:**
- 4-5 bars for clarity
- Play triangle on left
- High contrast bars

## CONCEPT 5: Stacked Album Cards with Active Indicator

**Visual Description:**
Two overlapping album artwork cards with the front one highlighted/glowing, showing "current" vs "queue".

```
┌─────┐
│ ◉ █ │  Front card with active dot indicator
│ ─┼─ │  Partial second card behind
└─────┘
```

**Alternative:**
```
  ┌──┐
 ┌┼──┼┐  Two cards, front one glowing/active
 │●  ││  Active indicator dot
 └───┘│
  └──┘
```

**Why It Works:**
- Stacked cards = playlist/queue concept
- Front card highlighted = "currently playing"
- Active dot/glow = live playback status
- Contextualizes as player with queue

**Colors:**
- Front card: Bright orange-yellow gradient (active)
- Back card: Muted orange (queued)
- Active indicator: Bright yellow glow/dot

**At 16x16px:**
- Simplified to two overlapping squares
- Clear depth via color contrast
- Visible active indicator

## Recommended Approach

**Primary Recommendation: Concept 1 (Mini Album with Play Badge)**
- Most directly represents what the app does (shows album art)
- Play badge clearly indicates active playback
- Scalable and recognizable
- Professional and clean

**Secondary Recommendation: Concept 2 (Progress Bar with Dot)**
- Universal "now playing" metaphor
- Very clear semantic meaning
- Unique among menu bar apps

**Testing Recommendation:**
Create mockups of top 2-3 concepts at actual menu bar size with:
- Light mode menu bar
- Dark mode menu bar
- With adjacent system icons for context
- Test if meaning is immediately clear

## Key Differences from V1

**V1 Problems:**
- Waveform = just "audio" (static)
- Heart = too abstract, emotional
- Orbital = unclear meaning

**V2 Solutions:**
- Album + play = "playing this album NOW"
- Progress bar = "playback in progress"
- NOW badge = explicit current status
- EQ + play = "actively playing"
- Stacked cards = "current from queue"

All concepts now clearly communicate **ACTIVE PLAYBACK** and **CURRENT STATUS**, not just music/audio in general.
